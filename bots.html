         <p class="bio text"><bigger>LumaBot<br></brr></bigger>LumaBot is a private bot made as a replacement for MEE6 that currently exclusively handles levels, birthdays, and role reactions. It was developed by me after MEE6 began locking many of its previously free features behind their premium tier and began primarily focusing on Non Fungible Tokens and Cpytocurrency. A server that I am in was paying for their premium tier and I didn't want to finacially support them anymore, so I made my own. The bot features customizable XP gain and levels. The bot is written in Node/discord.js.</p>
