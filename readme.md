# hello

hey, my names TM0D, and i make some really bad programs. they seem to always get caught by anti virus programs, and i have put zero effort into finding out why.

my popular (and only projects) include: 

 - [NyaDesktop](https://github.com/TM0D/NyaDesktop), a port of the Nya Mod for Beat Saber for desktop (in case you dont want to play beat saber for some reason.
 - [BeatSaberDiscordLink](https://github.com/TM0D/BeatSaberDiscordLink), essentially the mod for twitch but for discord and uses oneclick instead.
 - [8](https://github.com/TM0D/8).
 
 all of these should have actions enabled so go in that tab for up to date versions. i do not promise that they work at all though.
